# hyundai-egmp-research
Hyundai Electric Global Modular Platform research for re-using components outside of their cars. This 800V architecture is shared between a number of products like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Genesis GV60.

This is mostly aggregating info I have found and to share my work and results.

The goal is to understand the CAN messages and pin-outs well enough to use the battery and motors in other projects and conversions.
